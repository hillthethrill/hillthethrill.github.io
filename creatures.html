      <h1>Kapre</h1>
      <p>Kapre is a filthy, black, hairy giant spirit who likes to smoke huge rolls of cigars, and hide within and atop large trees, particularly the balete and old acacia or mango trees. A Filipino bigfoot, it scares away little children who play at night. If you’re stuck in a place and you keep going around in circles, you’re said to be played around by a Kapre. To escape its control, you must remove your t-shirt, and wear it inside-out. They usually depicted with a cigar as large as the trunk of a tree.</p>
      <p>These are hairy giants with glowing eyes and a cigar that never burns out. They can usually be found sitting atop of trees waiting for nightfall to scare naughty children who are outside of their homes late at night. The Kapre is a unique Filipino monster because he doesn’t steal fetuses, eat people or cut them up. The Kapre simply enjoys scaring children… and I suppose laughing at them for being scared.</p>
      <p>Some stories claim they are actually very friendly beings who can grant wishes if you find their magical white stone. One can assume a Kapre is nearby when trees sway while there is no breeze or you see faint smoke from high above, probably from the Kapre‘s cigar.</p>
      <p>In Tagalog folklore, a kapre or cafre is a very tall, hairy man with pitch-black skin. He can take on various shapes and disappears at will. Although regarded as an evil entity which plays harmful pranks, terrifies night wanderers, and abducts or rapes women, the kapre can be friendly towards humans, especially those with mental disability. It is said the kapre hates salt.</p>
      <p>What is perhaps the simplest creature in Philippine Mythology, turns out to have a  very complicated past.</p>
      <p>It is described as being a tall (7 to 9 ft), big, black, hairy, muscular creature. Kapres are normally described as having a strong smell that would attract human attention.</p>
      <p>The Kapre is said to wear the indigenous Northern Philippine loincloth known as bahag, and according to some, often wears a belt which gives the kapre the ability to be invisible to humans. In some versions, the kapre is supposed to hold a magical white stone, a little smaller in size than a quail egg. Should any person happen to obtain this stone, the kapre could grant wishes.</p>
      <p>Kapres are believed to be nocturnal and omnivorous. They are not necessarily considered to be evil. Unlike the Aswang, it does not eat humans or their unborn fetuses. However, it may turn vengeful when the tree that they are inhabiting is cut down.</p>
      <p>Kapres may make contact with people to offer friendship, or if it is attracted to a woman. If a Kapre befriends any human, especially because of love, the Kapre will consistently follow its ""love interest"" throughout life. Also, if one is a friend of the Kapre then that person will have the ability to see it and if they were to sit on it than any other person would be able to see the huge entity.</p>
      <p>They are also believed to have the ability to confuse people even in their own familiar surroundings; for instance, someone who forgets that they are in their own garden or home is said to have been tricked by a Kapre. Reports of experiencing Kapre enchantment include that of witnessing rustling tree branches, even if the wind is not strong. Some more examples would be hearing loud laughter coming from an unseen being, witnessing lots of smoke from the top of a tree, seeing big red glaring eyes during night time from a tree, as well as actually seeing a Kapre walking in forested areas. It is also believed that abundant fireflies in woody areas are the embers from the Kapre's lit Cigars or Tobacco pipe.</p>
      <p>White Kapre watches, black ones harm people</p>
      <h1>Aswang</h1>
      <p>Shapeshifting demon, humanlike by day but transform into different monstrous form at night. By day, they look like a beautiful, silent maidens dwelling in a simple nipa hut, but by night Bird they become a terrible fiend that feeds to human flesh and blood. They can make humans be like them whenever they serve flesh food (which is actually human flesh) and whenever you swallow something inflicted by their saliva. Their power can be also transferred just like that of Amaranhig.  They harass and eat awake humans at night, especially pregnant women who are about to give birth.</p>
      <p>Aswangs can change from a human to an animal form, usually as a bat, a pig or a black dog. Some aswangs can change form at will, others through the use of foul oils concocted by evil magicians. Aswangs appear at night to prey upon unwary travelers or sleeping people. It is said that they have a peculiar liking for the taste of human liver. The myth of the Aswang is popular in the Visayas, especially in provinces such as Capiz, Antique, and Iloilo. </p>
      <p>Aswangs also have a peculiar liking for the fetus of pregnant women and are said to find their quarry by the scent of the mother, which to the aswang smells like ripe jackfruit. Upon finding the house of the pregnant mother, the aswang alights on the roof from where it stretches its tongue until it is as thin as a thread and uses it to enter the womb and feast on the fetus.</p>
      <p>They break into funeral homes and steal recent corpses. They are also known to enter homes to drink human blood and can turn people into aswang by tricking the human to bite them in return. The aswang are especially hungry for human fetus so some of the more superstitious stories include neighborhoods patrols set up in front of the home of a pregnant woman to protect her from wandering stray animals in case they are the aswang in disguise.</p>
      <p>Distinct from ordinary cannibals, aswang refers to men and women who feed on the blood, flesh, and life force of people through supernatural means.Some don’t attack people but prefer to steal and eat corpses. Others can sever their upper bodies at the waist and leave the lower half, flying in the night sky to hunt for prey. There are those who don’t prey on people at all but use sorcery or witchcraft to harm their enemies. Most aswang possess superhuman strength, swiftness, and longevity.</p>
      <p>A myth in Bicol, on the other hand, suggests that aswang takes root from the god of evil Asuan or Asuang.Some accounts allege that an aswang, when in its human form has rotten middle toenails. </p>
      <p>Bolo can kill them if hit on the right spot on the back.</p>
      <p>Possessing a combination of the traits of either a vampire, a ghoul, a warlock/witch, or different species of werebeast, or even all of them together. It is the subject of a wide variety of myths and stories. Spanish colonists noted that the Aswang was the most feared among the mythical creatures of the Philippines, even in the 16th century.</p>
      <p>They may also replace their live victims or stolen cadavers with doppelgangers made from tree trunks or other plant materials. This facsimile will return to the victim's home, only to become extremely sick and then die. An aswang will also have bloodshot eyes, the result of staying up all night searching for houses where wakes are held to steal the bodies.</p>
      <p>Aswangs are physically much more like humans at daytime; they only change their appearance at night when they feel they are in need of food. It has been said that if an aswang married a human, upon their wedding, his or her mate would become an aswang as well but rarely can they reproduce. The couple may hunt together at night but will go in separate directions, either to avoid quick detection or because they do not like to share their food.</p>
      <p>Aswangs can also be befriended, they can talk to you like any normal human: they laugh and/or cry, get angry/sad, get hurt/humiliated and feel shy and envious. These creatures do not harm their friends and neighbors, and were said to be exempted from their target victims for food, hence the Filipino saying, ""Mas mabuti ang aswang kaysa sa isang magnanakaw"" (English: ""Better an aswang than a thief"").</p>
      <p>Aswangs are said to be vulnerable during daytime because during that time they do not have the excessive superhuman strength that they have in their nighttime prowl (aswangs only transform at night because they believe that God is dead or sleeping).</p>
      <p>Like vampires, aswangs are repelled or killed by using garlic, salt and religious artifacts/weapons (e.g. Holy water, crucifix, rosary, prayers and religious verses). They are also killed using a whip made entirely of a stingray's tail (buntot pagi), which may also be used to repel the creature (aswangs are said to be scared of the sound made by the whip's cord slashing through the air). It is also said that they cannot step on holy consecrated ground (i.e. churches, mosques, temples, etc.). Decapitation is also a way to destroy an aswang.</p>
      <p>Certain agimats (native Philippine amulets) and special prayers posted on doors and entrances may also repel aswangs. A good example of which is the red and black bead bracelets worn by newborn babies.</p>
      <h1>Pugot Mamu</h1>
      <p>Next to the aswang, the Pugot Mamu may be the most well-known Philippine boogeyman</p>
      <p>It is a headless being, like the more famous Pugot, with a few major differences. The Pugot is said to be the spirit of a beheaded priest and really only scares people, while the Pugot Mamu is flesh and bone, with an insatiable appetite for children.  How does he eat them without a head?  Well, his neck and shoulders are a giant carnivorous hole in which the children are fed.</p>
      <h1>Manananggal</h1>
      <p>A flying fiend, and carries only half its body, bodies are cut in half at night. Some says, like Aswang, by day, they are beautiful maidens living in a nipa hut, by night, they rub a kind of oil to their whole body which gives them the power to separate themselves into two – the upper part which she carries with batlike wings, and the lower part which they live, then goes back to connect its upper part before the dawn.</p>
      <p>Manananggal is an aswang that can fly after separating itself from the lower half of its body. It eats babies and fetuses from a mother’s womb. It eats babies by means of passing their long tongue through a small hole from the roof of a house. The sharp end of the tongue touches the mother’s navel to suck the blood of the fetus or unborn child.</p>
      <p>At other times, she seduces men with her beauty and lures them to a private place before eating them alive. She usually eats the insides, like the heart, stomach or the liver. Sunlight is deadly to the Manananggal when she is in her monstrous form. Should her two halves still be separate with the coming of dawn, she will be destroyed.</p>
      <p>According to legend, to destroy the Manananggal, one should search for the lower torso that she leaves behind during her nightly hunts. Salt, ash, and/or garlic should then be placed on the exposed flesh, preventing the monster from combining again and leaving it vulnerable to sunlight. Small containers of salt, ash, and raw rice, and the smell of burning rubber are said to deter the Manananggal from approaching one’s house.</p>
      <p>The Manananggal is sometimes considered to be a special breed of the aswangs. These creatures generally take on the form of a beautiful woman with large, leathery bat wings.</p>
      <p>After taking her clothes off she rubs a special oil all over her body while chanting an incantation until a pair of batlike wings sprout from her back. She grows a pair of fangs and her fingernails turn into sharp talons. Her body then separates at the waist and with a flap of her wings her upper body flies off, leaving her lower half behind.</p>
      <p>On a full moonlit night, some manananggal stare at the moon until gooey tears come out of their eyes and the upper body detaches."</p>
      <h1>Wakwak</h1>
      <p>A human, birdlike creatures flying in the night sky in search for flesh and blood. It could be a witch itself, or night bird belonging to a witch. Also said to be a blood sucker like creature who can take the form of a night bird.</p>
      <p>Wakwak is assumed to grab humans at night as its prey, just like Manananggal and the Kikik who can fly. It likes to haunt in the rural areas of the Philippines. The Wakwak has no ability to separate its torso from its body. Some people believed that it is a night bird that belongs to a witch.</p>
      <p>The Wakwak makes a sound by flapping its wings while flying. The sound that it produced is typically linked to the presence of an Unglu (vampire) or Ungo (ghost or monster). The Wakwak’s sound also indicates that it is searching for victims. When the sound is loud, it means that it is far from you. If not, then it is near you and ready to attack. The Wakwak rips and maims its victims and then feeds on their hearts. The old folks described the Wakwak as creatures with long sharp talons and a pair of wings just like bats. Its talons or claws are used in slashing its victims in order to retrieve their hearts.</p>
      <p>In the movies it is normally portrayed as flying in an upright position. My father who grew up in Antique, in the island of Panay, says this is not so. He has a relative who saw a Wakwak flying over a bamboo grove. Dad’s kin says with all lucidity and sobriety that the thing flew upside down.</p>
      <p>She said she saw what she thought was a large, tawny looking bird with sharp, black talons just a few feet above her head. Its flapping wings disturbed the leaves and brushes for yards around. What struck her though was the looks of the creature’s head. She says the thing had a pretty humanoid and feminine face with yellow curly hair. She described its face as looking “like a doll.” Its wings were that of a bird, not a bat. And she says by the dancing light of the torches she can tell the thing is staring at her with cold, grey eyes.</p>
      <h1>Aniani</h1>
      <p>A manananggal can also be a sorceress that visits villages and barrios. To feed, the self-segmenter chooses an isolated place where she will leave her lower torso while she hunts at night.Bird When she separates from her lower torso, she then gains her ability to fly. She then goes off in search of houses where pregnant women reside. Upon choosing a suitable victim, the Manananggal alights on the house and inserts her tongue through the roof. The tongue is long, hollow and extremely flexible. She uses it to puncture the womb of the sleeping woman and to suck out the fetus. At other times, she seduces men with her beauty and lures them to a private place before eating them alive. She usually eats the insides, like the heart, stomach or the liver. Sunlight is deadly to the Manananggal when she is in her monstrous form. Should her two halves still be separate with the coming of dawn, she will be destroyed. According to legend, to destroy the Manananggal, one should search for the lower torso that she leaves behind during her nightly hunts. Salt, ash, and/or garlic should then be placed on the exposed flesh, preventing the monster from combining again and leaving it vulnerable to sunlight. Small containers of salt, ash, and raw rice, and the smell of burning rubber are said to deter the Manananggal from approaching one’s house.</p>
      <h1>Aswang Na Gala</h1>
      <p>A psychic blood sucker, it feeds directly on the energy of sick, weary, stressed, or dying persons. It appears very human, with some working in hospitals as nurses to feed on the patients. An Aswang na Gala can be identified by staring into its eyes, which reflect images upside-down. Sometimes it feeds on the life force of the fetus inside an expectant mother’s womb.</p>
      <h1>Aswang Sa Kalibonan</h1>
      <p>An ancient Aswang who lives away from humans and resides in the deepest part of the forest. This Aswang is powerful and is feared as well as respected by other Aswangs. It keeps a lot of black chicks which it uses to turn normal humans into Aswangs. It has a hairy body. Underling Aswangs share their spoils to the Aswang sa Kalibonan.</p>
      <h1>BagOng Yanggaw</h1>
      <p>Humans who have just been turned into Aswangs. Having just acquired their abilities, the Bagong Yanggaw are weaker than other Aswangs but still fast and strong enough to kill a human. They can shapeshift into an animal but for a limited time only as their concentration is not yet fully developed. Having acquired an insatiable appetite for humans, they could be careless sometimes which often results to foiled attacks. Some may even doubt themselves, desperately clinging to their humanity, and seek to be rid of their condition.</p>
      <h1>Bangkilan</h1>
      <p>Powerful female Aswangs who could turn into big black boars. They are so powerful they could turn a normal human into an Aswang through a kiss. In Cuyonen, Bangkilan means fierce pig or boar.</p>

      <h1>Buring Catanda</h1>
      <p>It is similar to Agta and Kapre, who were dark-complexioned, hairy-skinned giant, and looks like either an old man or woman with a very long hair. The behavior of this creature depends on how people treat them. If you do unpleasing things to them, they can be vengeful while if you do good to them, they can give you a reward.  They are also depicted like engkantos with a distinct black skin.</p>
      <h1>Dalaketnon</h1>
      <p>A beautiful elitists, said to control the Aswang, Manananggal, Amalanhig, Tikitik, Balbal, and Wakwak, and are powerful and evil spirits. They dwell in the socalled Dalaket.</p>
      <p>Dalaketnons appeared as a gothic like tall, handsome males and beautiful females. They dress in fashionable manner, live in the ""haunted house-like"" mansions and try to fit in with mortal people. Some believe that the only way to Dalaket, their dwelling place, is by entering the Dalaket trees. These creatures abduct people and take them to their world. They hold a feast for their victims and force them to eat the Black Rice that put them under their spell making them their slaves.</p>
      <p>Dalaketnons were known to be rather beautiful elitists. They have a bit of a coño, a kind of telekinesis as well as corporeal duplication—meaning they could generate tangible, living copies of themselves indefinitely, and their hairs and eyes turn white whenever their power manifests.</p>
      <p>The Dalaketnons have a normal contact with humans but the humans do not know that they are engkanto. Old folks believed that Dalaketnons can change an ordinary human into creatures like them. They use a magical black rice to change their victims into a Dalaketnon. It was also believed that they were the mortal enemies of the good engkanto. They are from the royal blood of evil engkantos that served as their ruler.</p>
      <h1>Diwata</h1>

      <p>In Philippine mythology, a diwata is a type of deity or spirit.  The term “diwata” has taken on various levels of meaning since its assimilation into the mythology of the precolonial Filipinos,  but its origin is in the Devata beings from Hinduism and Buddhism.</p>
      <p>The word “Diwata” although used in Tagalog does not retain its Indian/Hindu meaning. Among the Tagalogs, Diwata is usually understood as a fairy. In the Visayas however, the word Diwata is understood as equivalent to the word Anito or ancestor spirit.</p>
      <h1>Engkanto</h1>
      <p>Blond, good-looking, taller than ordinary humans. Has high-bridged nose and no philtrum.  They live in large trees, chiefly the balete.</p>

Some appear to be beautiful having blue eyes, fair complexion and golden hair.</p>
      <p>They may however have unusual features such as high-bridged noses, fair skin, blond hair and lack of philtrum. They have a wide range of appearances but one common fact of a different feeling or vibe than humans.</p>
      <p>Engkanto are most commonly known for either extreme malignant effects, or an overwhelming influence of luck. Those the Engkanto do not favor had become depressed, suffered from madness, or even disappeared for days or months, possibly as a result of the human possession. They are also said to be capable of causing fevers and skin diseases such as boils.</p>
      <p>They are often associated with the spirits of ancestors in the Philippines. They are also characterized as spirit sorts like sirens, dark beings, diwata, and more. Belief in their existence has existed for centuries, and continues, with some, to this day.</p>
      <h1>Gabunan</h1>
      <p>They are the experienced, oldest, strongest, and most cunning Aswangs. They usually don’t shapeshift into animals and remain strong and powerful during the day. They could attack a human even before sunset, pouncing on the victim, strangling him or breaking his neck. Most Gabunan are so swift you won’t see them coming. They fly without wings, sailing the night winds in search of a victim.</p>
      <p>Some Gabunan don’t kill their victim on the spot. Instead, they keep him tied and locked up. They then turn a tree or banana trunk or a bundle of twigs into a copy of the victim and order it to go home. Upon arriving home, the copy with get sick and later die, a sign for the Gabunan to slaughter the real victim. </p>
      <p>They could even steal a baby unnoticed, replacing it with a piglet or large fish that has been made to look like the victim. The oldest of Gabunans have coal-black skin, bloodshot eyes, protruding fangs, and long white disheveled hair when in their true form.</p>

When it sees a pregnant woman, it follows her at home where it would sit hidden outside or sneak inside the house unnoticed, hiding in the shadows by turning into a pitchblack form and sniff the scent of the unborn child. When it leaves, the baby inside the victim’s womb would also be gone, which result to severe pain and bleeding with the mother. It is assumed the Kantanod is not actually present in the vicinity but employs its astral body to spirit away the fetus.</p>
      <h1>Kimat</h1>

      <h1>Kumakatok</h1>
      <p>Before World War 2, three tall persons (two old folks and a young woman) dressed in hooded black robes would knock on the doors of houses in the middle of the night. Those who opened the door were told by the mysterious trio that a member of the family or household (usually the eldest or the one with an illness) will soon die. The trio usually showed up when there was an outbreak of diseases, especially cholera. They were believed to be harbingers of death.</p>
      <p>In some parts of Visayas, after hearing about the trio of knockers, people painted their doors with a white cross to keep the trio at bay. Then rumors spread that the trio knocked on the doors of business and government establishments and even in churches.</p>
      <p>After the war, visits from the trio became scarce until no one saw them again. It was speculated that most of the houses were destroyed in the war that the trio could not find a proper door to knock on. In Visayas they were called manoktok.</p>
      <p>A visit from the Kumakatok is usually an omen of death, as either the eldest member of the house or one who is ill, will be visited and subsequently die.</p>
      <h1>Magkukutud</h1>
      <p>The magkukutud (also spelled, magcucutud) is a nocturnal flier in Kapampangan folklore almost similar to the manananggal except that it has a flat nose and large ears. It also lays eggs in secluded places. When these eggs are found and cracked open they contain human body parts and organs. The magkukutud steals unattended corpses in wakes or digs out freshlyburied cadavers. Enchantment is allegedly used to make a corpse walk to the magkukutud’s house where the body is butchered and cooked.</p>
      <p>Like the manananggal, the magkukutud’s weakness is its discarded lower half. Should salt or pepper be sprinkled on the exposed stump of the lower half or if it’s destroyed, the creature won’t be able to rejoin with it and ends up dead by sunrise.</p>
      <h1>Manlalayog</h1>
      <p>Generally described as a woman whose hair grows very long and wire-like at night. With her hair, she strangles or suffocates a person while draining the victim’s life force which results in death. Life force from its victims keeps the Manlalayog young and strong.</p>
      <h1>Mutya</h1>

      <h1>Puting Baba</h1>
      <p>Subterranean, white skinned goblin-like creatures with very long chins. They make their chins protrude on the surface of the ground, making them appear as stones or mushrooms. Whosoever makes the mistake of tripping on them or picking them up is pulled underground.</p>
      <h1>Tahamaling</h1>
      <p>The red-skinned and yellow-eyed tahamaling of Bagobo folklore are considered as guardians of animals. These elusive female spirits of the forest are mostly active at night. They take care of wounded animals, including the domesticated ones in nearby villages. Those who were lucky to glimpse them say they wear nothing but bracelets and anklets made of bones. It is believed they inhabit trees.</p>      
      <h1>Tayho</h1>
      <p>The tayho (also spelled tayhu) of Western Visayan folklore are similar to the centaur of Greek mythology except they have beastlike faces and have the ability to disappear at will. During full moonlit nights a tayho could be glimpsed roaming the forest or the swampy areas abundant with mangroves. Most persons who see them end up staring blankly in the air for a few moments or lose their way should they attempt to follow the creatures. The tayho are hard to track down because they don’t leave any tracks or hoof prints on the ground. It is believed they live in a different realm.</p>
      <p>It is said the tayho are the offspring of a female water buffalo and a giant male agta.</p>
      <h1>TikTik</h1>
      <p>A kind of Aswang. There are two kinds of Tiktik. The one who eats fetuses, and the one who warns people of the presence of Aswang in their place.</p>
      <p>Folklore concerning the tiktik is widespread in the Philippines, therefore, the creature’s characteristics vary from one tale to another. </p>
      <p>In some anecdotes, the tiktik is a variant of the aswang that lives as a normal person by day but turns into a huge, black bird after dark and preys on the child inside a pregnant woman’s womb or on a bedridden sick person. It inserts through a hole on the roof or through the window its long, hollow, and pointed tongue which could become as thin as thread. The tongue pierces the sleeping victim’s womb through the navel and sucks the fetus’s blood or digests the child itself and sucks it out like drinking through a straw. It uses the same tongue to suck the life force of a sick person.</p> 
      <p>In other tales, the tiktik reverts to its human form upon landing on a prospective victim’s roof. Its name is said to be derived from the sound it makes. There is a belief that when the tiktik’s shriek is loud, it’s still far away; but when its sound grows faint, it means it’s nearby. Also, gusts of wind despite a calm weather indicates that it’s on the prowl.</p>
      <p>In other areas the tiktik is a black bird that serves the aswang, helping the latter locate potential victims, hence, the name which in Tagalog means “spy.” This bird alights on the roof of potential victims and calls for its master. One legend, however, says that the tiktik is an enemy of the aswang. Its cries warn the people that an aswang is nearby.</p>
      <h1>Tiyanak</h1>
      <p>An infant-like creatures that eat the living and terrify children. There origin (some says) are aborted fetuses from mother’s womb who took revenge of not giving them birth, or babies who died before receiving baptism. After death, they go to a place known as Limbo, a chamber of Hell which unbaptized dead people fall into and are transformed into evil spirits. These phantasms return into the mortal realm in the form of goblins to eat living victims. The tiyanak can also be the offspring of a woman and a demon. It can also be an aborted fetus which comes back to take revenge on its mother. Most Tiyanaks are said to live in forests. If they see a human, they transform into what looks like a normal baby. When the person notices the Tiyanak and comes near to take a look at it, the Tiyanak changes back to its true form and eats its prey.</p>
      <p>The true origin of Tiyanak came from the Malaysian creature, Pontianak or Mantianak – a female viscera. They share many similarities, but the Pontianak is the mother who died while pregnant, Tianak is the ghost of the child, not the mother herself.</p>
      <p>Whenever we hear Tiyanak, the first thing which come to our mind is an innocent-looking baby, but according to some, they look like dwendes (small earth spirit). You can kill this monster by means of any pointed instruments, more specifically pointed metal made of silver.</p>
      <p>The tiyanak is similar to the Greek mythological siren in that it lures its prey with its voice. A person hears a baby cry from deep in the woods and then follows the sound to rescue the baby. Some stories say the person wanders aimlessly in search for the baby and becomes hopelessly lost. Other stories claim that the person eventually finds a baby in the middle of the woods. When it is picked up, the baby then shapeshifts into a monster with large, sharp teeth. It then eats the person and transforms back to a baby to await its next victim. With either version, the story ends with “… and he was never found again.”</p>
      <p>Bicolano, Ilocano, and Tagalog folklore describe the tiyanak (also spelled, tianak) as a small, baldheaded old man with wrinkled skin, bloodshot eyes, pointed teeth, pointed ears, and small horns. Its right leg is absurdly longer than its left leg, making it difficult for the creature to walk, thus, it hops when on the move. It disguises itself as a baby abandoned in the field or in the woods. It attracts people with its infant-like wails and when a person picks it up, the creature reverts to its hideous form and mauls the victim until he is dead. In other tales, the tiyanak prefers to prey on women, especially those who breastfeed. Disguised as a plump baby wailing in hunger, the woman who finds the tiyanak is moved to breastfeed it, only to have her blood sucked dry by the creature. With the woman dead, the tiyanak turns into a black bird and flies away.</p>
      <h1>Agta</h1>
      <p>A hairy giant spirit living in the forest, mostly in large trees as Balete Tree. They are similar to Kapres but they are romantic beings. Snatches up females after being lured by flower petal shower. They feed on wicked spirits of men after driving them crazy then seduce them to suicide.</p>
      <p>The agta of Waray folklore is a man as black as charcoal, very tall (some say around 9 feet tall), has long kinky hair, and goes about naked. He is active after dark between 8 p.m. to 4 a.m., hanging out in big trees while smoking a tinostos (cigar), wandering alone, following people, or sneaking in houses and scaring those who see him. As a prankster, the agta topples trees on the path of travelers or steals firewood and clothes left to dry outdoors. </p>
      <p>He likes women and may abduct one once in awhile. With a shower of petals, the agta lures a woman to a secluded area, captures her, and brings her to his lair where she’ll serve as his bride. Most of the abducted women either go insane or die of fright. A woman may escape the agta’s clutches by hitting his private part. This giant contends with those who attempt to acquire the mutya (pearl) of a certain variety of banana plant, which endows its possessor with supernatural abilities.</p>
      <p>In Western Visayas, the agta is a small, dark-complexioned, and solitary being. This diminutive agta only shows itself to people it likes, especially children and beautiful women. It could also be seen by bending over and looking down backward through the opening between the legs. Being fond of women and children, the agta may pinch one in the leg sometimes, leaving a dark mark on the skin.</p>
