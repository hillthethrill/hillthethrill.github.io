      <h1>Izzy Hill</h1>
      <p>I am a high school Senior who writes a lot! Since I have this nasty habit of getting bored with the books I have attempted to write, I thought I might actually be able to finish one if finishing it means I graduate... I make poor choices sometimes.</p>
      <p>I started writing when I moved to a new town in the 8th grade. It was a way for me to express myself while I was too shy to actually do that at the time. Since then I've only actually finished one short story (it was featured on some teen writing website). However, I've started writing around 12 books; creating characters, making outlines for the plot, and getting to the 9th chapter before quitting because I was bored of it. Sophomore year my friends got me interested in FIRST Robotics where I could write for the team. From grants, essays, or sponsorship request emails, I began to form my professional writing voice and began to teach other how to write effectively. I love seeing what I can bring to kids who don't know much or think a lot about writing and I'm hoping I can bring the same to people who read my book(s)!</p>
      <h1>Dumb Facts About Me:</h1>
      <p>I like dogs, the color green, Buffy the Vampire Slayer (show), Burn Notice (show), elephants, volunteering, and robotics!</p>
      <p>Surprisingly I don't want to write for a living. My aspiration is to become a politician to help shape the country and others lives. I want to double major in Marketing and Economics (or Finance) and minor in Political science before going to law school. I think no matter what I end up doing I'll be writing in some way whether it be legislation or writing another book in my spare time!</p>
      <p>Thanks for reading this! It means a lot anyone would want to learn more about me! Enjoy the book!</p>
