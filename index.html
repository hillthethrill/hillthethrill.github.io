        Hi! If you're reading this then you've somehow made it to my website! For right now I'm just 
        uploading my Capstone but in the future I think I'll upload other books I've been working on. 
        Anyways I'd love if you'd read it and give any feedback if you could! None of my chapters are 
        set in stone and I'm constantly changing things.
        
        Feel free to look at the creatures before, during, or after reading! This is supposed to an 
        educational thing... but the creatures are pretty interesting! I doubt that all will make an 
        appearance in the book but like I said, they're very interesting. I read through 200+ bios on 
        creatures and chose those which I thought would work well with the plot so the list is by no 
        means complete.
